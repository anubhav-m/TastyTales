    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kheer is a traditional Indian rice pudding infused with aromatic spices like cardamom and garnished with nuts such as almonds and pistachios. This creamy dessert is enjoyed warm or chilled, making it perfect for any occasion.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Basmati rice</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
        <li>10-12 strands saffron (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped almonds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped pistachios</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon raisins (optional)</li>
        <li>A pinch of nutmeg powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Rose water or kewra water (optional, for flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice under running water until the water runs clear. Drain excess water and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add the washed rice to the boiling milk and reduce the heat to low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the rice is cooked and the milk has thickened to a creamy consistency (about 30-40 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron to the pan. Stir well to combine and continue to cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
        <li>Add chopped almonds, pistachios, and raisins (if using). Stir well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat. If using, add a pinch of nutmeg powder and a few drops of rose water or kewra water for enhanced flavor.</li>
        <li>Allow the kheer to cool slightly before serving. It can be served warm or chilled, garnished with additional nuts and saffron strands if desired.
