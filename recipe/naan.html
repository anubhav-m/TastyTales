    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter (for brushing)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate the yeast by dissolving the sugar in the warm water, then stirring in the yeast. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes, until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Combine the flour, yogurt, milk, salt, and vegetable oil in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten each ball into a round or oval shape about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. If desired, mix the melted butter with the minced garlic for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Cook the naan in the hot skillet, one at a time. Cook for 2-3 minutes on one side, until bubbles form and the bottom is golden brown. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes on the other side.</li>
        <li>Brush the cooked naan with melted butter (and garlic, if using) and sprinkle with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
