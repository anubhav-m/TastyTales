    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup urad dal (black gram)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the batter: Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately under running water. Soak them in water for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Grind the ingredients: Drain the soaked rice and dal. First, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds to a smooth paste, adding water as needed. Next, grind the rice to a smooth batter. Mix both batters together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Ferment the batter: Add salt to the batter and mix well. Cover the bowl and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight, until the batter has doubled in volume and is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dosa: Heat a non-stick skillet or a cast-iron griddle over medium heat. Grease it lightly with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter: Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the skillet. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.</li>
        <li>Cook the dosa: Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the edges start to lift and the bottom is golden brown and crispy. If desired, flip the dosa and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the dosa from the skillet and serve immediately with chutney and sambar. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
