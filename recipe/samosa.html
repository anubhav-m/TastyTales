    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil or ghee</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green peas, boiled</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh coriander, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and vegetable oil or ghee. Gradually add water and knead into a firm dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: In a pan, heat a tablespoon of oil. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add the chopped onions and green chilies, and saut√© until the onions are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the mashed potatoes, boiled peas, garam masala, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes. Add chopped coriander leaves and mix. Let the filling cool.</li>
        <li>Shape the samosas: Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. Roll each ball into a thin oval or circle. Cut each circle in half to form two semi-circles.</li>
        <li>Form a cone shape with each semi-circle by folding it and sealing the edge with water. Fill the cone with the potato mixture and seal the top edges to form a triangular samosa. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Fry the samosas: Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in a few samosas at a time. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve hot samosas with your favorite chutney or sauce. Enjoy!</li>
